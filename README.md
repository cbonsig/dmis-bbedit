DMIS Codeless Language Module for BBEdit / TextWrangler. This is a .plist that provides
syntax highlighting for DMIS keywords for popular Mac text editors.

Copy the DMIS.plist file to:
~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/DMIS.plist
..or...
~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/DMIS.plist

Reportedly, you can also copy to:
~/Dropbox/DMIS.plist
